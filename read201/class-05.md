### Choosing Images for Your Site
A picture can say a thousand words, and great images help make the difference between an average-looking site and a really engaging one.

### Storing Images on Your Site
If you are building a site from scratch, it is good practice to create a folder for all of the images the site uses.

### Adding Images
`<img>`
to add an image into the page you need to use an  `<img>` element. This is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag). It must carry the following two attributes:
`src`
This tells the browser where it can find the image file. This will usually be a relative URL pointing to an image on your own site. (Here you can see that the images are in a child folder called images â€” relative URLs.
`alt`
This provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it.
`title`
You can also use the title attribute with the `<img>` element 
to provide additional information about the image. Most browsers will display the content of this attribute in a tootip when the user hovers over the image.

### Height & Width of Images
`height`
This specifies the height of the image in pixels.
`width`
This specifies the width of the image in pixels.
