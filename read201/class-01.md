A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal. Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of  all the instructions.  Computers approach tasks in a different way than  humans, so your instructions must let the computer  solve the task prggrammatically.  To approach writing a script, break down your goal into  a series of tasks and then work out each step needed  to complete that task (a flowchart can help).

It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and  CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension. 
The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages  to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like  the <link> element can be used to load a CSS file).  If you view the source code of the page in the browser,  the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML,  because the script works with the model of the web  page that the browser has created.
