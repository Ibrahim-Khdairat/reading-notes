# Read 03 "Structure web pages with HTML"

-  ## Chapter .8  : " Extra Markup " 

In this chapter we'll :

- Specifying different versions of HTML
- Identifying and grouping elements
- Comments, meta information and iframes


- ### Chapter .8.1 " Specifying different versions of HTML "

Since the web was first created, there have been several different versions of HTML.
Each new version was designed to be an improvement on the last (with new elements and attributes added and older code removed).

#### HTML 4   &    XHTML 10 . 
Where you should be particularly aware of browsers not supporting certain features, I have made a note of this (as you have seen with some of the HTML5 elements introduced in the Forms chapter — and as you will see in the CSS chapters). With the exception of a few elements added in HTML5 (which have been highlighted), the elements you have seen in this book were all available in HTML 4. Although HTML 4 had some presentational elements to control the appearance of pages, authors are not recommended to use them any more. (Examples include the <center> element for centering content on a page, <font> for controlling the appearance of text, and <strike> to put a line through the text — all of these can be achieved with CSS instead.) In 1998, a language called XML was published. Its purpose was to allow people to write new markup languages. Since HTML was the most widely used markup language around, it was decided that HTML 4 should be reformulated to follow the rules of XML and it was renamed XHTML. This meant that authors had to follow some new.
