# Read 02 Revision And The Cloud
In this read we'll talk about **Seeing Your Remoots** :

By running the  `` git remote``  command, you can view the short names, such as “origin,” of all specified remote handles.

By using   ``git remote -v``  , you can view all the remote URLs next to their corresponding short names.



***Example***

$ cd example

$ git remote -v

remote1 https://github.com/remote1/example (fetch)

remote1 https://github.com/remote1/example (push)

remote2 https://github.com/remote2/example (fetch)

remote2 https://github.com/remote2/example (push)

remote3 https://github.com/remote3/example (fetch)

remote3 https://github.com/remote3/example (push)``
